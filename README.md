# OCR and Document Search Prototype

## Overview
This project is a web-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and document search prototype developed as part of an internship assignment at PARIMAL IIT Roorkee. The application enables users to upload images and PDFs, extract text from these documents, and search for keywords within the extracted content.

## Features
- **File Upload**: Users can upload images (JPG, PNG) and PDFs.
- **Text Extraction**: Utilizes Tesseract OCR to extract text from uploaded documents.
- **Keyword Search**: Allows users to search for specific keywords within the extracted text.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Gradio for a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language for the application.
- **Tesseract OCR**: An open-source OCR engine used for text extraction.
- **Gradio**: A Python library for creating interactive web applications.
- **OpenCV**: A library used for image processing (optional, if included).
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical operations (optional, if included).
- **Pillow**: A library for image handling and manipulation (optional, if included).
